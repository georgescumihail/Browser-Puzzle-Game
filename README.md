# Browser Puzzle Game

My year 3 project for the Multimedia class. It is a puzzle game created with HTML/JS, on a canvas element, and developed into a Progressive Web Application. You can use any photo to play it, it has sound effects, Bootstrap styling, JavaScript transparancy effects while moving the pieces, and finish time displayed after completing the game.
